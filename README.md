# Description
The aim of this project was to create a command-line application that produced a ReadMe file from the user input information.

This application will allow users to create a ReadMe file based on their answers to the questions. They will need to download the repository and run the file within the terminal and Node.js in order to answer these questions. From there, their answers will automatically save to a markdown ReadMe file which will allow them to push this directly to their repository and their ReadMe will be complete.

# Demonstration
Please see screenshots of the working application below:

You can see the user input here for the questions:

Here is the ReadMe file that has been produced based on the users inputted answers. You can see the preview alongside it, showing its functionality:

Below is the final product once the ReadMe file has been pushed to the repository:

You can see below the questions that the user is being asked, as well as the page that this has created and an example of this opening the autofilled email application:

# Installation 
In order to use this application, users will need to download the index.js file as well as download node.js in order for the application to run in the terminal. (The user can also download the repository if they wish to have all of the code) They will then be able to access the new ReadMe file that has been created using their answers. They can then do as neccessary with this, including pushing it to their repository and this will display as desired.

This application can be used as many times as necessary in order for the user to get the file they require. If a user does not wish to answer all of the questions again, they will be able to edit their answers within the "README. md" file they have created.

# Improvements
If i were to have the opportunity to continue with this project, i would like to add more License options in order to of use to as many users as possible.
